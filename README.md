Find the minimum number of deletions required to convert a string into a palindrome
Given a string, find the minimum number of deletions required to convert it into a palindrome.

For example

Input: "ACBCDBAA"

Output: 3

Explanation: The minimum number of deletions required is 3 to obtain the palindrome "ABCBA" or "ABDBA".

Input: "racecar"

Output: 0

Explanation: The input string is already a palindrome, so no deletions are required.
